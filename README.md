# Angular Playground

Welcome to **Angular Playground** ‚Äì a hands-on learning repository for mastering Angular, from the basics to advanced concepts. üöÄ

## üìå About This Repository

This repository is designed as a structured learning path for Angular, starting from fundamental concepts like project setup and components to more advanced topics such as reactive forms, signals, and service injection.

Tasks within this repository are organized by difficulty and build upon each other, allowing you to
incrementally learn Angular concepts. Each task has a dedicated branch with a solution, so you can check your
work or skip ahead if needed. Tasks and solutions do not include step-by-step guides on how to solve the problem,
only pointing to some challenges or interesting facts. Instead, we encourage you to use all tools available as
Angular docs, Stack Overflow, and Google. AI tools are not recommended as they usually solve the problem without
learning anything, but feel free to ask them if you are not sure about the correctness of your solution (or note
the question for your supervisor). Tests are not included,
but you can add them as an extra challenge.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customization
