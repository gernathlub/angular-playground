# 🎯 Task 1.2: First Changes & Code Cleanup  

## 🏆 Goal  
In this task, you'll get familiar with the structure of an Angular project, clean up the pre-generated code, and experiment with small modifications to see how Angular works.  

🔹 **Don't worry if you don’t fully understand components or routing yet!** We’ll dive deeper into them in **Chapter 2**.  

## 📂 1. Explore the Project Structure  
Before making changes, take a moment to explore your Angular project’s structure.  

🔗 **Reference:** [Angular Project Structure Guide](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure)  

- **Check `src/app/` folder** – This is where most of your work will happen.  
- **Look at `app.module.ts`** – It defines the main module of your app.  
- **Review `app.component.ts`** – This is the root component that Angular loads first.  

## 🏗️ 2. Understanding `AppComponent`  
Open **`app.component`** and examine its structure

🔹 **Best Practices:**  
- Please check best practices in Angular style guide:

🔗 **Reference:** [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)  

## 🧹 3. Remove Pre-Generated Code  
Open **`app.component.html`** and **remove all pre-generated code** (you’ll find comments marking it).  

Also, remove styles marked by comments from **`app.component.css`**.  

## 👀 4. Check the Changes in the Browser  
Save your changes and check the output in the browser.
Start the app if not already running:  

```sh
ng serve
```  

You should now see a page with Readme instructions withou the Angular welcome element in the bottom of the page.  

## 🧪 5. Experiment!  
Try modifying some other parts of your app.component; feel free to experiment a bit and get comfortable with base angulare structure.

See how the changes reflect instantly in your browser.  

## ✅ Task Completion  
If you've:  
✔️ Explored the project structure  
✔️ Cleaned up `app.component`  
✔️ Removed unnecessary styles  
✔️ Checked your changes in the browser  
✔️ Experimented a little...  

Then you're ready to move forward! 🚀  

🔹 **Next Task:** Diving deeper into Angular components!
